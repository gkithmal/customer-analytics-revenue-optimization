## Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Data Foundation (`01_data_exploration.ipynb`)

**Objective:** Establish data quality and derive foundational customer metrics

**Key Processes:**
- Data quality assessment and anomaly detection
- Missing value imputation using statistical methods
- Outlier identification and treatment (IQR methodology)
- Feature engineering for customer behavior metrics
- Exploratory data analysis revealing customer distribution patterns

**Deliverables:**
- Clean, analysis-ready datasets
- Customer lifetime value calculations
- Purchase frequency and recency metrics
- Revenue distribution analysis

### Phase 2: Customer Segmentation (`02_customer_segmentation.ipynb`)

**Objective:** Implement RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for customer stratification

**Technical Implementation:**
- Quintile-based scoring methodology (1-5 scale)
- Statistical validation of segment characteristics
- Customer lifecycle mapping and behavioral profiling
- Segment-specific value proposition development

**Segment Classification:**
- **Champions** (11.2%): High-value, frequent, recent customers
- **Loyal Customers** (15.7%): Consistent purchasing behavior
- **Potential Loyalists** (18.3%): Growth opportunity segment
- **New Customers** (22.1%): Recent acquisition cohort
- **At Risk** (17.4%): Declining engagement, retention priority
- **Cannot Lose Them** (15.3%): High-value dormant customers

### Phase 3: Predictive Analytics (`03_ml_modeling.ipynb`)

**Objective:** Develop machine learning models for customer lifetime value prediction and automated classification

**Model Development:**
- **Customer Lifetime Value Prediction**
  - Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
  - Performance: R² = 0.84, RMSE optimized
  - Features: Transaction history, behavioral patterns, demographic data

- **Customer Tier Classification**
  - Multi-class classification for automated customer scoring
  - Accuracy: 82% with cross-validation
  - Output: Gold/Silver/Bronze/Platinum tier assignments

- **Churn Risk Assessment**
  - Logistic regression for retention prioritization
  - AUC: 0.78 with balanced precision-recall

**Model Validation:**
- K-fold cross-validation (k=5)
- Feature importance analysis
- Performance benchmarking against baseline models

### Phase 4: Business Intelligence (`04_executive_dashboard.ipynb`)

**Objective:** Transform analytical insights into strategic business recommendations

**Components:**
- Executive dashboard with KPI visualization
- ROI projections and financial impact modeling
- Strategic implementation roadmap with timeline
- Campaign development and targeting strategies

**Strategic Outputs:**
